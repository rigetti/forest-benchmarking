    Measures the quantum volume of a quantum resource, as described in [QVol].

    By default this method scans increasing depths from 2 to len(qubits) and tests whether the qc
    can adequately implement random model circuits on depth-many qubits such that the given
    depth is 'achieved'. A model circuit depth is achieved if the sample distribution for a
    sample of num_circuits many randomly generated model circuits of the given depth sufficiently
    matches the ideal distribution of that circuit (See Eq. 6  of [QVol]). The frequency of
    sampling 'heavy-outputs' is used as a measure of closeness of the circuit distributions. This
    estimated frequency (across all sampled circuits) is reported for each depth along with a
    bool which indicates whether that depth was achieved. The logarithm of the quantum volume is by
    definition the largest achievable depth of the circuit; see
    extract_quantum_volume_from_results for obtaining the quantum volume from the results
    returned by this method.
