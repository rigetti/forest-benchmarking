Installation Guide
==================

**A few terms to orient you as you are installing:**

1. **pyQuil**: An `open source Python library  <http://github.com/rigetti/pyquil>`_ to help you write and run quantum programs written in *quil*.
2. **Quil**: The `Quantum Instruction Language <https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03355>`__. 
3. **QVM**: The `Quantum Virtual Machine <https://github.com/rigetti/qvm>`__ is an open source implementation of a quantum abstract machine on classical hardware. The QVM lets you use a regular computer to simulate a small quantum computer and execute Quil programs.
4. **QPU**: Quantum processing unit. This refers to the physical hardware chip which we run quantum programs on.
5. **Quil Compiler**: The `open source compiler <https://github.com/rigetti/quilc>`__, ``quilc``, compiles arbitrary Quil programs to the supported lattice and instruction for our architecture. 
6. **Quantum Cloud Services**: `Quantum Cloud Services <http://rigetti.com/qcs>`_ offers users access point to our physical quantum computers and the ablity to schedule compute time on our QPUs.  If youâ€™d like to access to our quantum computers for QCVV research, please email support@rigetti.com.



Step 1. Install pyQuil and the Forest SDK
-----------------------------------------
::

	pip install pyquil

Next you must install the SDK which includes the Rigetti Quil Compiler (quilc), and the Quantum
Virtual Machine (qvm). `Request the Forest SDK here <http://rigetti.com/forest>`__. You'll
receive an email right away with the download links for macOS, Linux (.deb), Linux (.rpm), and Linux (bare-bones).

If you dont already have Jupyter or Jupyter lab now would be a good time to install that too.

::

    pip install jupyterlab


Step 2. Install forest-benchmarking
-----------------------------------
`forest-benchmarking` can be installed from source or via the Python package manager PyPI.

**Note**: NumPy and SciPy must be pre-installed for installation to be successful, due to cvxpy.

**Source**

::

	git clone https://github.com/rigetti/forest-benchmarking.git
	cd forest-benchmarking/
	pip install numpy scipy
	pip install -e .


**PyPI**

::

		pip install numpy scipy
		pip install forest-benchmarking




Step 3. Build the docs (optional)
---------------------------------
We use sphinx to build the documentation. To do this, first  install the requirements

::
	
	pip install sphinx
	pip install sphinx_rtd_theme
	pip install nbsphinx
	
then navigate into Forest-Benchmarkings top-level directory and run:

::

		sphinx-build -b html docs/ docs/_build

To view the docs navigate to the newly-created docs/_build directory and open the index.html file in a browser.
