    "# Observable Estimation\n",

    "There are many cases in Forest Benchmarking, and QCVV broadly, where we are interested in estimating the expectations of some set of Pauli observables at the end of some circuit (aka `pyquil.Program`). Additionally, we may be interested in running the same circuit after preparation of different starting states. The `observable_estimation.py` module is designed to facilitate such experiments. In it you will find\n",

    "The procedure which likely leverages this abstraction most fruitfully is [quantum process tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tomography#Quantum_process_tomography). If you aren't familiar with tomography at all, check out this [notebook](tomography_process.ipynb) for some background. The goal is to experimentally determine/characterize some unknown process running on our quantum computer (QC). Typically, we have some ideal operation in mind specified by a `pyquil.Program` that we want to run on the QC. Running process tomography will help us understand what the actual experimental implementation of this process is on our noisy QC. Since process tomography involves running our process on many different start states and measuring several different observables, an `ObservablesExperiment` should considerably facilitate implementation of the procedure."

In fact, if you set `num_shots` to some large number, say 500,000, then you'll notice that the list of results have expectations grouped around three distinct values, roughly `.95`, `-.82`, and `.064`. These values are what one would predict given the states measured are $|+\\rangle$, $|-\\rangle$, and some equal superposition, respectively, and given that the readout noise model has the default parameters $\\Pr(\\rm{measure } \\ 0 \\ | \\ \\rm{actually }\\  0) = .975$ and $\\Pr(\\rm{measure } \\ 1 \\ | \\ \\rm{actually }\\  1) = .911$. \n",

    "Note that the parameterization of readout noise assumes that we can only measure in the computational (Z) basis. Indeed, the way we 'measure X' or any other non-Z observable is by first performing some pre-measurement rotation and then measuring in the computational basis (we do these rotations so that the plus eigenstate on a single qubit corresponds to 0). Thus, all of our observables are impacted similarly by readout error; some measurements may incur some additional observable-dependent error due to the noisy pre-measurement rotations.\n",

For a general state both parameters impact the resulting expectation. Instead of explicitly measuring each such parameter we instead opt to 'symmetrize' readout, which has the effect of averaging these parameters into a single 'symmetrized readout error'. For a single qubit this is achieved by measuring two 'symmetrized' programs for each original measurement. The first program is exactly equivalent to the original. The second program is nearly identical, except that we perform a quantum bit flip before measuring the qubit, and post measurement we classically flip the result. We then aggregate these results into one collection of 'symmetrized readout results'. We can directly calculate how this procedure affects the above calculations:\n",

Again, this has the effect of averaging over asymmetric readout error so that the aggregated results are characterized by a single 'symmetrized readout error' parameter. It is this single parameter that we correct for, or 'calibrate', below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calibrating estimates of symmetrized observable expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that when running on a QPU we will likely have substantial readout error (which you can estimate [here](readout_error_estimation.ipynb)). If we symmetrize the results then the symmetrized readout error will scale all of our expectations in a predictable way. We have included a calibration procedure that can help mitigate the impact of symmetrized readout error by estimating and undoing this scaling. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, after obtaining symmetrized estimates for expectations of some set of observables during an experiment you can pass on these results to `calibrate_observable_estimates`. By default, for each observable in the set this will prepare all eigenstates of the observable and estimate the expectations. The `calibration_expectation` recorded is the average magnitude of all of these expectations. Each new `ExperimentResult` stores the original input `expectation` under `raw_expectation` and populates `expectation` with the original expectation scaled by the inverse `calibration_expectation`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `calibrate_observable_estimates` method itself leverages readout symmetrization. We first create an experiment that prepares one particular positive eigenstate for the observable and measures its expectation. We then symmetrize this program (under default exhaustive symmetrization this essentially prepares all eigenstates) to get back a single estimate of the `calibration_expectation`; this is precisely an estimate of the 'symmetrized readout error' parameter which is what we need to rescale our results to +/- 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "The ability to group compatible settings for parallel data acquisition on the same run of the QC makes it quite simple to generate a single parallel experiment from a group of `ObservablesExperiment`s which operate on disjoint sets of qubits. The settings across these experiments will automatically be compatible because they operate on different qubits, and the programs can be composed without ambiguity. Even when two settings share a qubit this parallelization can be done, although in this case it may be to less effect. When two programs act on a shared qubit they can no longer be so thoughtlessly composed since the order of operations on the shared qubit may have a significant impact on the program behaviour. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, even when the individual experiments act on disjoint sets of qubits you must be careful not to associate 'parallel' with 'simultaneous' execution. Physically the gates specified in a pyquil `Program` occur as soon as resources are available; meanwhile, measurement happens only after all gates. There is no specification of the exact timing of gates beyond their causal relationships. Therefore, while grouping experiments into parallel operation can be quite beneficial for time savings, **do not** depend on any simultaneous execution of gates on different qubits and be wary of the fact that measurement happens only after **all** gates have finished. The latter fact may lead to significant time delays for the measurement of a qubit that would be measured promptly in the original program--remember that during this 'idle time' the qubit is likely experiencing decoherence, which will likely impact the results.
