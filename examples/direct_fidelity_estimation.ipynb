    "\n",
    "The code that we've developed has some assumptions baked in that are important to understand. We have implemented DFE for a restricted subset of states and processes using these assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we assume that our start state is always the pure state $|0 \\rangle$ on all qubits. On $n$ qubits this state can be decomposed as \n",
    "$$ \\rho_0^{\\otimes n} = \\left(I_0 + Z_0\\right) \\otimes \\left(I_1 + Z_1\\right) \\otimes \\dots \\left(I_n + Z_n\\right) / 2^n  = \\frac{1}{2^n} \\sum_{k=1}^{2^n} P_k $$\n",

    "$$\\sigma = \\tilde U \\rho_0 \\tilde U^\\dagger$$\n",
    "Meanwhile we want to calculate the fidelity between $\\sigma$ and the ideally prepared state $\\rho = U \\rho_0 U^\\dagger$. By linearity we can calculate $\\rho$ by conjugating each Pauli term $P_k$ in the sum above by the ideal program $U$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\rho = \\frac{1}{2^n} \\sum_k U P_k U^\\dagger $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**The assumption** we make is that the ideal prep program $U$ is an element of the Clifford group. Since the Clifford group is the [normalizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralizer_and_normalizer) of the Pauli group, these conjugated terms $U P_k U^\\dagger$ will again be some Pauli $P'_k$ (in the code we use a `pyquil.BenchmarkConnection` to quickly calculate the resultant Pauli). Following the example above we arrive at the set of Paulis $\\{P'_k\\}_k$ whose expectations we need to estimate with respect to the physical state $\\sigma$. The estimate is the average of all these Pauli expectations (see Eqn. 1 of [DFE1]). Note that we don't need to estimate the expectation of the all $I$ term since we know its expectation is 1. We exclude this term in experiment generation but include it in the analysis 'by hand'. \n",
