    "## Motivation and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomized benchmarking is a commonly used protocol for characterizing an 'average performance' for gates on a quantum computer. It exhibits efficient scaling in the number of qubits overwhich the characterized gateset acts and is robust to state preparation and measurement noise. The RB decay parameter which is estimated in this procedure can be related to an estimate of 'average gate error' to the ideal, although some care is needed in interpreting this quantity; in particular note that the estimated gate error is *not* the gate infidelity averaged over the *native gateset* for our QPU. When we say gate error below we refer to this more nuanced notion of average *Clifford* gate error. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea of the protocol is to employ random sequences of gates where the ideal composite operation of the sequence is the identity. To produce such a sequence of depth `m+1`, each of the first `m` gates in the sequence are picked uniformly at random from the Clifford group. Using the group composition and inverse property the last gate is then uniquely determined as the Clifford element which inverts the composition of the previous `m` gates. For illustration refer to this snippet from appendix A1 of [Logical Randomized Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.03688.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/rb_ckt.png\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the presence of noise the actual sequence of Cliffords $[U^{-1}, U_m, U_{m-1}, \\dots, U_2, U_1]$ is affected by noise $\\Lambda$, and there is state preparation $\\Lambda_P$ and measurement error $\\Lambda_M$, so the circuit does not enact an identity operation. Instead there is some 'survival probability' `< 1` of measuring the initial state after enacting the sequence. After estimating this 'survival probability' over many independent random sequences of increasing depth $d$ one can fit an exponential decay of the form (under some assumptions):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A_0 p^d + B_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We get this relatively simple form thanks to the fact that averaging over Clifford sequences effectively averages any noise channel $\\Lambda$ to the depolarizing channel; this, in turn, is because the Clifford group forms a [unitary 3-desgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_t-design).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we've saved a plot of 2q RB data. Each data point is the survival probability estimated for a single sequence of a particular depth. The fit parameters $A_0$ = amplitude, $p$ = decay, $B_0$ = baseline are reported in the `variables` section below the plot:\n",
    "![](figs/rb_decay.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter $p$ estimated from this fit is the RB 'decay' which can be related to the average gate error $r$ by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r = 1 - p - (1 - p) / \\textrm{dim} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "A brief summary of the procedure follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select some set of depths over which you expect the survival probability to decay significantly\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate many random sequences for each depth\n",
    "\n",
    "- Estimate the 'survival probability' for each sequence by taking the fraction of outcomes matching the initial state over many shots. Here we use the `ObservablesExperiment` framework which estimates observable expectation values from which we can calculate the survival probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fit an exponential decay model to the estimated survival probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Extract the decay parameter from the fit and convert to 'average gate error'\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the interpretation of RB is an active field of research; see [Wallman](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09835v4) and [Proctor et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01853) for more information.\n",
