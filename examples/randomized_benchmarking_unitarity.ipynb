    "# Randomized Benchmarking: Unitarity RB\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we explore the subset of methods in `randomized_benchmarking.py` that are related specifically to unitarity randomized benchmarking. I suggest reviewing the notebook `examples/randomized_benchmarking.ipynb` first, since we will assume familiarity with its contents and treat unitarity as a modification to the 'standard' RB protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "In standard RB we are interested in characterizing the average impact of noise on our gates, and we estimate an average error rate per Clifford. Unitarity RB is designed to characterize this noise further. There are two different types of noise that impact the quality of a target operation\n",
    "\n",
    "- coherent, or unitary, noise which can arise from imperfect control or improper calibration such that the resulting operation is unitary but different from the target gate. For example, an extreme case of coherent error would be implementing a perfect X gate when trying to perform a target Z gate. A more common and insidious case of coherent noise is an over or under rotation, e.g. performing RX(pi + .001) for a target RX(pi) gate. \n",
    "\n",
    "- incoherent noise makes the overall operation non-unitary and can rotate the affected state out of the computational subspace into the larger system + environment space through unwanted interaction with the environment. For a single qubit state represented on the [Bloch sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere) this has the affect of moving the state vector closer to the center of the sphere. The [depolarizing channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_depolarizing_channel) is the archetype of incoherent error which in the single qubit case shrinks the surface of the Bloch sphere uniformly to the central point. [Amplitude damping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_damping_channel) is another example, where for a single qubit the surface of the Bloch sphere shrinks to the $|0 \\rangle$ state pole.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unitarity measurement is meant to provide an estimate of how coherent the noise is. Already in describing the examples we see that the two different types of noise affect states in different ways. Focusing on the Bloch sphere representation for single qubit states, fully coherent (unitary) noise rotates the surface of the sphere just like any other unitary operation; meanwhile, incoherent noise shrinks the volume of the sphere and, in general, translates its center. We will use the difference between these two actions on various states to characterize the noise. Just as in RB we will estimate the average of some quantity (the shifted purity) over groups of random sequences of Clifford gates of increasing depth, fit an exponential decay curve, and extract an estimate of the base decay constant. In this case, the decay constant is dubbed 'unitarity' and takes on a value between 0 and 1 inclusive. Purely coherent noise--as in the case of an extraneous unitary gate--yields a unitarity of 1 whereas purely incoherent noise--such as the depolarizing channel--yields a unitarity of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purity\n",
    "The [purity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purity_%28quantum_mechanics%29) $p$ of a quantum state $\\rho$ is defined as \n",
    "$$ p(\\rho) = tr(\\rho^2) $$\n",
    "The set of pure single qubit states, that is with $p=1$, is precisely the set of states which comprise the surface of the Bloch sphere. Indeed, we can relate the purity of a state to the length of the state vector in the generalized Bloch sphere. Using a complete operator basis such as the [pauli basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices) we can expand any $d$-dimensional quantum state $\\rho$ as a linear combination over basis matrices:\n",
    "$$ \\rho = (I + \\sum_k n_k \\sigma_k) / d = (I + \\sum_k tr[\\rho \\sigma_k] \\sigma_k)/d$$\n",
    "where we have denoted the traceless pauli matrices by $\\{\\sigma_k\\}$. Here we see that the purity is given as \n",
    "$$ p = tr(\\rho^2) = 1/d + ||\\vec n||^2/d$$\n",
    "where $\\vec n = (n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_{d-1})$ is the Bloch vector. The purity for quantum states lays in the interval $[1/d, 1]$. Following [ECN] we define a shifted (or normalized) purity bounded between 0 and 1:\n",
    "$$p' = \\frac{d (p - 1 / d)}{d-1} = ||\\vec n||^2/(d-1)$$\n",
    "Combining all of the observations above, we expect that the shifted purity $p'$ of an initially pure state under the action of incoherent noise such as repeated applications of a depolarizing channel will decay from 1 to 0 over the course of many applications as the Bloch vector shrinks to the origin. Indeed, it is the shifted purity that replaces the survival probability from standard RB. To estimate the purity we take the expectation of each traceless pauli operator $\\sigma_k$ measured on a given sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The protocol\n",
    "There are two differences between unitarity and RB. First and foremost, we estimate the purity of each sequence rather than the survival probability. Secondly, we don't need the sequence of Cliffords to be self-inverting. Hence the procedure is summarized as\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select some set of depths over which you expect the survival probability to decay significantly\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate many random sequences for each depth. A random sequence is simply depth-many uniform random Clifford elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Estimate the 'shifted purity' for each sequence estimating the expectation of each traceless Pauli observable after running the sequence; the `ObservablesExperiment` framework is used heavily here. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Fit an exponential decay model to the estimated shifted purities. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Extract the decay parameter (unitarity) from the fit. From this we can get an upper bound on the standard RB decay. If the noise channel is a depolarizing channel then this upper bound is saturated. \n",
