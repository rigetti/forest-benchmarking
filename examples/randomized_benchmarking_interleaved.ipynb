    "# Randomized Benchmarking: Interleaved RB\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we explore the subset of methods in `randomized_benchmarking.py` that are related specifically to interleaved randomized benchmarking (IRB). I suggest reviewing the notebook `examples/randomized_benchmarking.ipynb` first, since we will assume familiarity with its contents and treat IRB as a modification to the 'standard' RB protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "In standard RB we are interested in characterizing the average impact of noise on our gates, and we estimate an average error rate per Clifford. Interleaved RB is designed to characterize a particular gate, which is 'interleaved' throughout the standard RB sequence. The protocol is a simple extension of standard RB which involves running sequences of random Cliffords with the gate of interest G interleaved after every Clifford. Specifically, we transform a standard RB sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_1, C_2, C_3, \\dots , C_{N-1}, C_{\\textrm{inverse}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "into an 'interleaved' sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_1, G, C_2, G, C_3, G, \\dots , C_{N-1}, G, C'_{\\textrm{inverse}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where G is the gate we wish to characterize. Note that we still need to invert the sequence, so G must be an element of the Clifford group, and the final inverting gate must be updated to invert the entire sequence of gates including the G.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The IRB protocol can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- we want to characterize a gate G which acts on the set of qubits Q\n",
    "- run standard RB on the qubits Q and estimate an rb decay. \n",
    "- generate another set of sequences with the gate G interleaved in each sequence. Run these sequences exactly as you would for standard RB and estimate an rb decay, which we will call the irb decay. We expect this parameter to be smaller than the standard rb decay due to the effect of the extra applications of G. \n",
    "- use the two decay parameters to calculate the error on gate G. We can also get lower and upper bounds on the fidelity of G.\n",
    "- (Optional) run a unitarity experiment on the qubits Q and use this to improve the fidelity bounds from the last step.\n",
