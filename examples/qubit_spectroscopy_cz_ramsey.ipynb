    "# Qubit spectroscopy: CZ Ramsey measurement example\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to a $T_2^*$ Ramsey experiment, a CZ Ramsey experiment measures fringes resulting from induced Z rotations, which can result in non-unitary CZs. To rectify this non-unitarity, we determine the correction we need to apply to each qubit in the form of `RZ` rotations. If a CZ is perfectly unitary (or has been compensated for adequately with `RZ` pulses), a CZ Ramsey experiment should return 0 radians for each qubit. If, however, some correction is required, these angles will be non-zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "A sample QUIL program at one data point (specified by the equatorial Z rotation which maximizes excited state visibility when equal to the required `RZ` correction) between qubits 0 and 1 would look like \n",

    "Since we can natively parameterize `RZ` rotations continuously on our hardware, we are able to make use of [Quil 2.0's parametric program compilation](https://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/migration3-declare.html?highlight=parametric%20program%20compilation#Parametric-compilation) using `DECLARE theta REAL[1]` and `RZ(theta) 0`.
