    "\n",
    "Similar to a $T_2^*$ Ramsey experiment, a CZ Ramsey experiment measures fringes resulting from induced Z rotations, which can result in non-unitary CZs. To rectify this non-unitarity, we determine the correction we need to apply to each qubit in the form of `RZ` rotations. If a CZ is perfectly unitary (or has been compensated for adequately with `RZ` pulses), a CZ Ramsey experiment should return 0 radians for each qubit. If, however, some correction is required, these angles will be non-zero. \n",
