    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to assess the decoherence time, $T_1$, of one or more qubits on a real quantum device using pyQuil. A $T_1$ experiment consists of an X pulse, bringing the qubit from $|0\\rangle$ to $|1\\rangle$ (the excited state of the artifical atom), followed by a delay of variable duration. \n",
    "\n",
    "The physics of the devices is such that We expect the state to decay exponentially with increasing time because of [\"energy relaxation\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_(NMR)). We characterize this decay by the time decay constant, which we call $\\Gamma =1/T_1$. The parameter $T_1$ is refered to as the qubit's \"relaxation\" or \"decoherence\" time. A sample QUIL program at one data point (specified by the duration of the DELAY pragma) for qubit 0 with a 10us wait would look like \n",

    "**NB: Since decoherence and dephasing noise are only simulated on gates, and we make use of DELAY pragmas to simulate relaxation time, we cannot simulate decoherence on the QPU with this experiment as written. This notebook should only be run on a real quantum device.**"
