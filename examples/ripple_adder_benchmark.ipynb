    "# A simple ripple carry adder on the QPU\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook use a \"simple\" reversible binary adder to benchmark a quantum computer. The code is contained in the module `classical_logic`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benchmark is simplistic and not very rigorous as it does not test any specific feature of the hardware. Further the whole circuit is classical in the sense that we start and end in computational basis states and all gates simply perform classical not, controlled not (`CNOT`), or doubly controlled not (`CCNOT` aka a [Toffoli gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toffoli_gate)). Finally, even for the modest task of adding two one bit numbers, the `CZ` gate (our fundamental two qubit gate) count is very high for the circuit. This in turn implies a low probablity of the entire circuit working.\n",
    "\n",
    "However it is very easy to explain the performance of hardware to non-experts, e.g. *\"At the moment quantum hardware is pretty noisy, so much so that when we run circuits to add two classical bits it gives the correct answer 40% of the time.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover the simplicity of the benchmark is also its strength. At the bottom of this notebook we provide code for examining the \"error distribution\". When run on hardware we can observe that low weight errors dominate which gives some insight that the hardware is approximately doing the correct thing.\n",
