### Library Philosophy

The core philosophy of Forest-QCVV is to separate: 

* Experiment design and or generation
* Data collection
* Data analysis
* Data visualisation

We ask that code contributed to this repository respect this separation. We also ask that an example of how to use your contrubited code is placed in the `/examples/` directory along with the standard documentation found in `/docs/`.
