    State fidelity between the experimental state σ and the ideal (pure) state ρ
    (both states represented by density matrices) is defined as F(σ,ρ) = tr σ⋅ρ [Joz]_.

    The direct fidelity estimate for a state is given by the average expected value of the Pauli
    operators in the stabilizer group of the ideal pure state (i.e., Eqn. 1 of [DFE1]_).

    The average gate fidelity between the experimental process ℰ and the ideal (unitary)
    process 𝒰 is defined as F(ℰ,𝒰) = (tr ℰ 𝒰⁺ + d)/(d^2+d) where the processes are represented
    by linear superoperators acting of vectorized density matrices, and d is the dimension of the
    Hilbert space ℰ and 𝒰 act on (and where ⁺ represents the Hermitian conjugate). See [Nie]_ for
    details.

    The average gate fidelity can be re-written a F(ℰ,𝒰)=(d^2 tr J(ℰ)⋅J(𝒰) + d)/(d^2+d) where
    J() is the Choi-Jamiolkoski representation of the superoperator in the argument. Since the
    Choi-Jamiolkowski representation is given by a density operator, the connection to the
    calculation of state fidelity becomes apparent:
    F(J(ℰ),J(𝒰)) = tr J(ℰ)⋅J(𝒰) is the state fidelity between Choi-Jamiolkoski states.

    Noting that the Choi-Jamiolkoski state is prepared by acting on half of a maximally entangled
    state with the process in question, the direct fidelity estimate of the Choi-Jamiolkoski
    state is given by the average expected value of a Pauli operator resulting from applying the
    ideal unitary 𝒰 to a Pauli operator Pᵢ, for the state resulting from applying the ideal
    unitary to a stabilizer state that has Pᵢ in its stabilizer group (one must be careful to
    prepare states that have both +1 and -1 eigenstates of the operator in question, to emulate
    the random state preparation corresponding to measuring half of a maximally entangled state).
