    In general, this experiment consists of multiple iterations of the following steps performed for
    different depths and measurement in different "directions":
        1) Prepare a superposition between computational basis states (i.e. the eigenvectors
            of a rotation about the Z axis)
        2) Perform a change of basis which maps the computational basis to eigenvectors of the
            rotation.

            eigenvector component picks up a phase from the rotation. In the 1-qubit case this
            means that the state rotates about the axis formed by the eigenvectors at a rate
            which is given by the relative phase between the two corresponding eigenvalues.
        4) Invert the change of basis to return to the computational basis.
        5) Prepare (one of) the qubit(s) for measurement along either the X or Y axis.
